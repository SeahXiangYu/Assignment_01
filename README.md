# Assignment 1 (RADWIMPS Band Website)

This is a website where it displays information of the band, RADWIMPS. The front/landing page is where users would see the bands most recent/popular work. There are 4 other pages within the wesite, a profile, news/live, album and contact us page. The website can be a good stepping stone for them to learn more about the band and better enjoy their work. Additionally, the website also attracts anime fans as RADWIMPS are rather popular in the anime scene, producing soundtracks for popular animated movies such as the recent Suzume No Tojimari, Weathering With You and Your Name to name a few. 

# Design Process
The website is mainly targetted towards newer fans of the band and anime fans. The website's mainpage is to show the band's most recent work and from there, users can explore other pages within the website. 

To navigate to the respective pages, the user would have to press on the menu icon on the top right of the screen. The user can then choose which page he would like to visit. Additionally, clicking on the logo at the top left of the website would redirect the user back to the main page.
In the profile page, it displays an image on the band, as well as a brief introduction of the band. Moreover, if the user scrolls down, one would be able to view the band's history. In the news page, the most recent news about the band is shown by its title and the date to show recency. Additionally, users can scroll down to watch the bands most recent live performances.
In the albums page, the albums of RADWIMPS are displayed. Upon hovering over the album cover, it displays the album's name. The user can then click on the album they would like or are interested in, it would then scroll them to the respective embeded playlist for them to play the song.
In the contact page, the user can fill up a form and submit an inquiry.

# Features

## Existing Features
* Animated Menu Icon - Upon clicking the menu icon, the icon changes to a cross, and upon clicking on it again, returns to its original look
* Overlay Navigation Menu - Clicking on the menu icon drops a overlay where users can use to navigate to other pages
* Logo - Redirects user back to main page
* Footer - Has social media icons redirecting to RADWIMPS' respective social media
* Smooth Scroll - When the user clicks on the album cover, the page will scroll to the respective section the embeded playlist is located at

## Features Left to Implement
* Would be better if the album scrolls to a section where the playlist is collapsed, and user can open it when they want.
* Contact page currently does not store any information and is a dummy feature, so would like to make it useful
* Certain parts of the website is not really responsive, especially the transition between desktop to mobile 

# Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

# Testing

1. Main page:
   * The page is not very responsive when you shrink the screen. The only two sizes the website looks good is at the default desktop size and mobile view below 500px. 501px and above till before desktop screen has a lot of blank space at the bottom and the text does not appear nicely
2. Profile page:
   * The page looks good on desktop view, but upon shrinking it down to mobile view, the band history section starts moving out of place
3. Contact page:
   * The submit button on the contact page only redirects user back to same page since there is no actual place to store the form information
